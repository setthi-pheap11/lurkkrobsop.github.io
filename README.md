*Note: If you run your files via a file folder it will be not work becuase we use (fetch API) in JavaScript, So Browsers often block file:// fetch requests. To resolve this,      you should serve your files via a local server. You can use tools like:

- VS Code Live Server Extension
- Node.js HTTP Server
- Python's SimpleHTTPServer
